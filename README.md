# shipviz

### Features
* All-in-one solution for visualising proprietary geospatial data in the browser
* Multiple user accounts on data server
* All data interaction/animation through the web-interface
* Step-by-step guides for shipping related knowledge extraction
* Sample data of vessel movements/characteristics for use in tutorial


### Description

ShipViz is a visualisation tool and knowledge extraction manual for global movement data, in particular for AIS data originating from ship-borne transceivers.
The visualisation is based on [CartoDB] (https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb) an open-source tool for storing and visualising such geospatial data.

We require an instance of CartoDB that allows for data storage on a local server rather than ‘the cloud’ (due to data license agreements) and we provide a comprehensive guide and all the installation scripts to do this, see [here] (https://github.com/UCL-ShippingGroup/shipviz/wiki/CartoDBInstallation).

Furthermore, we showcase a number of typical research and policy questions for AIS data with the included data sample and how to [solve] (https://github.com/UCL-ShippingGroup/shipviz/wiki/ShipVizTutorial) these using ShipViz.

Examples (under development, see some code [here](https://github.com/UCL-ShippingGroup/shipviz/tree/master/examples)):
* Vessels travelling to/from certain areas
* Local and global changes in ship supply
* Behavioural patterns
* Minimum sailing distance to point/area of interest

### Further information
Please refer to the [shipviz wiki] ( https://github.com/UCL-ShippingGroup/shipviz/wiki) for an installation guide and scripts as well as links to the tutorial. For questions and features under development, see the [issue pages] (https://github.com/UCL-ShippingGroup/shipviz/issues).

### Contributions
